hi yes, you are reading my amazing markdown file. this will be incredibly detailed and document my journey in creating this fully.



okay. never mind, i wrote 2 words and just gave up. i used sympy or something, go read my shit code that could've been OOP-ed.



i was re-reading my md file, i sound like a 9 year old on youtube trying to be funny. maybe i should just delete this. this *technically* is documentation. just not the one programmers want. i mean, its not like anyone looks at my repos.
