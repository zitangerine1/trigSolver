# Introduction
A relatively simple text-based programme that solves right-angled and non-right-angled triangles with high accuracy. Angles and sides can be found, however only integer values are supported. This is aimed to reduce time spent using formulae (Sine Rule, Cosine Rule) that one is already familiar with.
